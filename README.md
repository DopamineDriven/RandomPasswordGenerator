# RandomPasswordGenerator

## Description

An application that generates a random password as a function of user-selected criteria. This criteria is selected by the user through a series of prompts once the button-widget "generate password" is clicked on. This app runs in a browser requiring the use of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to execute. 

* Password Length: betwen 8 and 128 characters

* There are four types of characters used for password generation:
    * (1) Special Characters
    * (2) Numeric Characters
    * (3) Lowercase Characters
    * (4) Uppercase Characters

* This application validates user input; ensures at least one character type is selected prior to executing generation

* The password is generated on the page in real-time once the prompts are answered

* There is a button-widget for the user to copy the displayed password to their clipboard

* This app is device responsive; seamlessly adapts to multiple screen sizes

* This application is useful insofar as aiding the user in the protection of sensitive content/data with a strong password. It eliminates the security threat of having weak, breachable, passwords. For example, the apparent Equifax data breach was a direct byproduct of those overseeing the data using the following username and password:
    * username: admin
    * password: admin

* Acceptance Criteria
    * Given that a user is seeking a new, secure, password
    * When they answer four consecutive prompts for password criteria
    * Then a random password meeting desired criteria is generated
